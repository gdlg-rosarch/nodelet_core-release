%description
The nodelet package is designed to provide a way to run multiple algorithms in
the same process with zero copy transport between algorithms. This package
provides both the nodelet base class needed for implementing a nodelet, as well
as the NodeletLoader class used for instantiating nodelets.

# in the install tree that was dropped by catkin, and source it.  It will
# set things like CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, PKG_CONFIG_PATH, and PYTHONPATH.
